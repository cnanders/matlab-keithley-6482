# About

MATLAB class for serial / GPIB communication with a Keithley 6482.  This class only implements part of the API that the hardware exposes. There is an optional user interface that requires the [Matlab Instrument Control](https://github.com/cnanders/matlab-instrument-control) library

# Requirements

MATLAB Instrument Control Toolbox (GPIB only, serial protocol does not require the additional toolbox)

# Optional

[cnanders/matlab-instrument-control](https://github.com/cnanders/matlab-instrument-control) (to create the UI)
